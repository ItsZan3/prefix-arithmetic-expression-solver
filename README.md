# prefix-arithmetic-expression-solver

This is my project for my Algorithms Course.

You enter a prefix equation, such as "+-/*/*8211412" and the equation gets solved.
It uses a stack to push each element and calculate every 2 numbers each time.
Basically, pop 2 numbers, do the operation, then push the result in the stack.
